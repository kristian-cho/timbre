**How I worked on this project**

After taking a React + Redux course (https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/), I decided to work on a large project to test my skills. Timbre was supposed to be a social media platform build out of my desire to retain the social features previously imbedded into Spotify. I used Javascript throughout the project with an (unfinished) React + Redux frontend with a firebase server running for the backend.

**How to navigate this project**

The frontend of the project is located in the client folder and the backend is located in the timbre-functions folder.

**Why I built this project this way**

While I did take a course in React + Redux, I primarily wanted to get some practice working with the backend of the project. I used social media development tutorials to set up the firebase server as well as all CRUD functions.

**If I had more time I would change this**

I managed to finish the backend (implementing all CRUD functions as stated above), organizing the database design behind functions such as making/deleting accounts, making/liking/reposting posts, etc. However, I was unable to develop the frontend, as I had focused heavily on learning backend design. Had I had more time, I would have built up the frontend to be more in-line with my vision of the application.

Part of why I was unable to finish the frontend was that I simply enjoyed working on the backend more. Testing the CRUD functions and learning about how to speed up database functions when given large amounts of reads/writes were interesting challenges that I had not quite experienced before due to my lack of classwork about those concepts.
